traits compiled from bibliographic references and my own work. Data are 
provided for more than 1000 plant species from all around the world.

A dataset of fleshy fruit traits compiled from bibliographic references and 
my own work. Data are provided for more than 1000 plant species from all 
around the world. The FRUBASE package accompanies: Jordano, P. 1995. Angiosperm 
fleshy fruits and seed dispersers: a comparative analysis of adaptation and 
constraints in plant-animal interactions. American Naturalist 145: 163-191.
